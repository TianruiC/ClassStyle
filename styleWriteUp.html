<h1>Batman Theme Write Up</h1>
<h4>Intro:</h4>
<p> Our theme is inspired by the batman comic books.  We wanted our page to have an old nostalgic batman feel while also including 
element of style that “adds life to the pages.”  Below we detail some of our major design features and challenges of our webpage’s design.
</p>
<h4>Design Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Colors and Font:  For our colors, we stuck to mainly black, yellow, and grey colors traditionally associated with Batman 
(I.E. the background, links, and title elements).  Additionally, we used two Google fonts to create the iconic “comic book feel.”  
The first was “Bangers” which reminded me of the style used for many batman comic overs and is featured in our title.  The second was 
“bubblegum sans” which while slightly more Halloween-ish in mood, reminded us of many of the text boxes or speech bubbles within the pages
of comics and was displayed as the main text of our body.</li>
<li>Side Bar: We used relative position on our side bar to create a dynamic bar to say with the reader the entire time.  
Though not directly correlated with the theme, it helps breath more life into the page while also enhancing functionality.</li>
<li>Villain boxes:  This is our proudest, and most distinct element of the webpage.  Inspired by comic book panels, each box is filled 
with a different villain from the Batman universe  By using the hover selector, each time you hover over a day box the villian’s image 
is changed to the pow onomatopoeia.  We like to image that each time you defeat the villain (changing their image to pow!) it is similar 
to each student’s “defeat” of the homework/assignments.  We also manipulate the text colors and each div’s background color to maximize 
readability.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Challenges/Questions:</h4>
<p>The biggest challenge we have while making the project was having a sidebar that employs relative positioning on the side while pushing
all other content to the right, so the sidebar is not superimposed over it.  Normally in web development, you would simply use a div to 
encapsulate all elements of the html that are not in the sidebar and increase it’s left margin to prevent this situation.  Unfortunately 
had to work within the parameters of the pre-existing html structure and adjust the margins for each element on the page.  
This was particularly challenging for the “day boxes” but under Dr. Bradshaw’s direction we were able to re-use or nth-child method to 
adjust the margins of the 1st and 4th boxes allowing to get the effect we desired.  While we tried to research it, we were unable to find 
a method to set the sidebar as the foremost element and push everything outside if it to the right.  If such an attribute exists, it 
would be useful to know and would have saved us a lot of time.</p>
<p>attribute exists, it would be useful to know and would have saved us a lot of time.
We also had trouble implementing the text colors over our images.  While we recognize that the images sometimes make the 
text slightly harder to read, we felt that including the pictures of the villains was worth sacrificing some of the ease of 
readability to achieve the desired theme.  To maximize readability, we had to employee multiple :hover selectors and change 
the colors of each box-individually.   We wonder if a technique or attribute exists that would make finding the color to 
optimize readability more easily.</p>
